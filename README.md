# Ansible Container Lab

**The Official Git Repository for _[Containerization with Ansible 2](https://www.packtpub.com/virtualization-and-cloud/containerization-ansible-2)_ by Aric Renzo**

## To the Reader
Thank you very much for taking the time to purchase and read my first book, _Containerization with Ansible 2_ and having the interest to go over the examples listed within the book.  It is my hope that you not only learn a lot from the book, but gain a deep level of understanding through the lab exercises contained within this repository. *Sincerely - Thank You.*

## Overview
This Github repository contains the supplemental content and code examples as seen in the book _[Containerization with Ansible 2](https://www.packtpub.com/virtualization-and-cloud/containerization-ansible-2)_ by Aric Renzo, available by Packt Publishing. The examples within this repository should be used in conjunction with the book and provide a reference for Ansible Container projects. Unfortunately, if you do not have the context of the book to go on, this repository won't be of much use to you. That being said, you should checkout my book, [here](https://www.packtpub.com/virtualization-and-cloud/containerization-ansible-2) 

This `README` file is broken up into two primary sections:
* **Updates**: Describes any updates that have been made in the Ansible Container project that may introduce changes that function differently than described in the book.

* **Errata**: Lists any fixes or corrections to content in the published book
